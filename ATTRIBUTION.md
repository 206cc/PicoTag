# PicoTag – Attribution & Name Policy

This document describes how the **PicoTag** project name and attribution should be handled.

It is intended to preserve authorship, project identity, and traceability, while keeping the source code fully open and permissive.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of the PicoTag **web UI** and its derivatives.

The **source code itself** is released under the MIT License and may be freely used, modified, and redistributed, including for commercial purposes.

---

## Project Name

**“PicoTag”** is the name of this open-source project.

When using the original or lightly modified PicoTag web UI:

- The project name **must not be removed or replaced**
- The project must not be presented as a different product under another name

If you substantially redesign, rebuild, or rebrand the project (for example, a completely new UI or a different product concept), you are free to use the code without the PicoTag name.

## Footer Attribution

When using the original or derived PicoTag web UI, the footer attribution included in the project must remain visible.

The footer typically includes references such as:

- PicoTag – Stringing Record
- Author or project credit
- A link to the official PicoTag repository

This attribution helps users identify the origin of the project and supports transparency within the open-source ecosystem.

If you create a heavily customized or rebranded version, attribution in documentation or an “About” page is appreciated.

You may use PicoTag in:
