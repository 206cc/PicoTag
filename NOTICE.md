## Data Handling & Responsibility (Public Web Interface Only)

PicoTag is a record-generation tool. For the Public Web Interface:

- Records are not actively deleted unless required (e.g. storage limits, technical constraints, misuse, or operational considerations).
- No specific data retention period is guaranteed.
- If a deletion password is lost, the record owner may request deletion assistance by providing the Tag ID.
- Records containing obvious personal data (e.g. full name, phone number, address, email) without protection may be removed.

Please avoid submitting personal or sensitive data, as PicoTag is not designed for storing such information.

Availability of the Public Web Interface is provided on a best-effort basis and **as is**, with **no service-level agreement (SLA), uptime guarantee, or warranties of any kind**.  
Long-term availability or continuity is **not guaranteed** and may be affected by technical, operational, or external factors.

Users are responsible for the content they submit and choose to make accessible.
